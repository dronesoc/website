Sean is a fourth year student studying Computer Science MEng. He became interested in drones a few years ago after watching videos by [Flite Test](https://www.youtube.com/user/flitetest) and now owns a total of six quadcopters, three of which were self-built. You can see some of his drone-related adventures on his [YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC6WZ_1nNi4fiK7X7NN0_wBA). His favourite drone pilot is [Mr Steele](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VKIxOhfoGM0).
