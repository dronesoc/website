Jashan is your treasurer. He is currently in his 4th year, studying Computer Science with Embedded Systems. He's had an interest in remote control stuff for a while, but only really got into it when he designed and built his first quadcopter a couple of years ago. He's interested in 3D printing (which is how he built his first quad!), and more generally anything that incorporates technology and moves... the latest example of this being Robot Wars, in which he was lucky enough to [participate in the new series](http://www.infernalcontraption.co.uk).
