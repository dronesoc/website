Sam is the first president of DroneSoc, which he maintains seemed like a good idea at the time. When he's not flying he studies Computer Science, juggles a multitude of hare-brained programming and electronics projects, and tries to keep the technology from exploding at [YSTV](https://ystv.co.uk). His favourite text editor is Vim, and he is a big fan of third person biographies. He can be found on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/swlcx).
